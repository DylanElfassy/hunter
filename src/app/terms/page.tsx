<h2 id="eligibility" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  1. Eligibility (Age and Location Requirements)
</h2>

     
<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3 mb-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Age Restriction:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old to create an account or use the Hunters App. The App is not intended for children or anyone under 18. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older. If we discover or have reason to believe you are under 18, we may terminate or suspend your account immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>United States Only:</strong> The Hunters App is intended for use within the United States only. You may not use the App if you are located outside of the U.S. We reserve the right to verify your location and to use geolocation technologies to confirm you are within a permitted territory. If you attempt to access the App from outside the U.S. (or from any jurisdiction where the App’s contests or features are prohibited by law), we may block or restrict your access. The App must not be used in any location where such use would violate any law or regulation; void where prohibited.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Location Services:</strong> To use the core features of this geolocation-based game, you must enable location services on your device. You consent to our collection and use of your device’s location information for gameplay and verification purposes, as outlined in our Privacy Policy (see Section 8 below). If you disable location access, the App’s primary features will not function properly and we may be unable to provide the service.
  </li>
</ul>


        <h2 id="account" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Account Registration and Security</h2>
      
<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3 mb-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Account Creation:</strong> To participate in Hunters gameplay (including finding “money drops” and receiving rewards), you will need to create an account. You agree to provide truthful, accurate, and current information during registration and to keep your account information updated. You may not impersonate anyone or provide false details. Each user may maintain only one account; creation of multiple accounts by the same individual is strictly prohibited and may result in termination of all associated accounts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. Do not share your account or password with others. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account, notify us immediately. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from someone else using your account due to your failure to safeguard your credentials.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Eligibility Verification:</strong> We may require you to verify your age or identity during account setup or at any time (for example, prior to awarding a cash prize). This verification may include providing government-issued ID or other documentation, as part of our efforts to enforce age restrictions and prevent fraud. You agree to provide such documentation promptly upon request. If you fail to do so, or if we suspect that you have provided false information, we may suspend or terminate your account.
  </li>
</ul>

        <h2 id="subscription" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Subscription and Billing</h2>
                <p>
The Hunters App is offered on a subscription basis. By subscribing, you agree to the fees and payment terms below:           
    </p>
     
<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3 mb-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Subscription Plans and Fees:</strong> Hunters is a paid service. We offer a Monthly Plan at $7.99 per month, and an Annual Plan at a rate discounted by 15% off the monthly price (equivalent to 12 months for roughly the price of 10.2 months). Subscription prices are in U.S. dollars and do not include any taxes that may apply.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> All subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period (monthly or annually, depending on your plan) unless you cancel before the next renewal date. By subscribing, you authorize Tamar (or the applicable app store platform) to charge the then-current subscription fee to your provided payment method at each renewal. Monthly plans renew each month on the same calendar day you subscribed (or the last day of shorter months), and annual plans renew on the yearly anniversary of your purchase.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Subscription purchases and payments are handled through the mobile platform you use (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play). You must have a valid payment method on file with the platform. We do not directly collect or store your credit card information; all billing is done by the platform under its terms. You agree to abide by your platform’s payment and subscription policies in addition to these Terms.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation stops future auto-renewal charges but does not retroactively refund the current subscription period. For example, if you cancel in the middle of a month, you will retain access to premium features until the end of that paid month, but the subscription will not renew for the next period. To cancel, you must use the App Store or Google Play account settings (or other applicable platform’s subscription management system) – simply deleting the App or logging out does not cancel your subscription. It is your responsibility to cancel before renewal if you do not want to be charged for the next period.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Refund Policy:</strong> In general, all subscription fees are non-refundable. No refunds or credits will be provided for partial subscription periods, unused features, or downgrades, except where required by law or by the app store’s refund policies. If you believe exceptional circumstances justify a refund, you may contact us at the support address listed in Section 14, but we make no guarantee of a refund.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Changes to Fees:</strong> Subscription prices and features are subject to change. We may modify our subscription fees or introduce new charges with at least 30 days’ advance notice to you (for example, by in-app notification or email). If you do not agree to a fee change, you may cancel your subscription before the new fees take effect. Continued use of the App after a fee change indicates your acceptance of the new pricing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Failure to Pay:</strong> If a subscription payment fails (e.g., due to an expired credit card or insufficient funds), your subscription may not be renewed. Please ensure your payment information is up to date. If payment cannot be processed, we reserve the right to suspend or revoke your access to subscriber-only features until you update your billing details and the subscription is successfully renewed.
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>
By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that the game is purely skill-based and entertainment-oriented. There is no guarantee that you will earn any prize, and your success depends on your own effort and ability. We reserve the right to modify game mechanics, challenges, and rules at any time to maintain fairness and compliance with the law. </p>

<h2 id="game-rules" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  4. Game Rules and Gameplay Mechanics (Skill-Based System)
</h2>

<p className="mb-2">
  Hunters is a location-based, skill-based game. It is not a gambling or chance-based platform. The core gameplay involves users physically moving to real-world locations to discover digital rewards (“money drops”) and completing skill challenges to earn prizes. We want to clarify how the game works and what it does not involve:
</p>

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3 mb-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Skill-Based Challenges:</strong> All rewards in the App are granted based on skill, strategy, or in-game achievements, not luck or chance. For example, you might need to solve puzzles, find hidden virtual objects, or be the first to reach a certain location. Outcomes depend on your ability and actions. There are no random drawings, lotteries, slot machines, or betting mechanics in Hunters. You are not wagering money, and there is nothing you can do in the App that resembles a casino game or sports bet. Because of this, Hunters is not considered gambling under applicable laws (it is a bona fide skill contest).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No Persistent Balances or Cash Deposits:</strong> The App does not maintain any monetary accounts or balances for users. You cannot deposit money into the App for betting, and you cannot accumulate a withdrawable cash balance. If you earn a cash reward (see Section 5 below), it is a one-time payout delivered to you externally; the App does not act as a bank or wallet holding funds on your behalf. There is also no in-game virtual currency that carries real-world monetary value.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> Aside from the subscription fee, Hunters does not require any additional purchase to play the core game. We do not sell loot boxes, gambling credits, or any chance-based items. Any in-app purchases (if offered in the future for cosmetic items or additional content) will not offer any competitive advantage in cash-reward challenges and will not be redeemable for cash.
  </li>
</ul>

<p className="mb-2">
  By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that the game is purely skill-based and entertainment-oriented. There is no guarantee that you will earn any prize, and your success depends on your own effort and ability. We reserve the right to modify game mechanics, challenges, and rules at any time to maintain fairness and compliance with the law.
</p>


        <h2 id="rewards" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Cash Rewards and Prizes</h2>
        <p>
Hunters may occasionally offer real cash rewards to users who achieve certain goals or win
specific challenges in the game. This section explains the terms for these cash prizes: </p>
<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3 mb-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Eligibility for Rewards:</strong> Cash reward opportunities may be offered through special events, “money drop” challenges, tournaments, or contests within the App. Each such event will have specific rules (for example, being the first to locate a particular virtual item, completing a skill task within a time limit, or achieving a top score on a challenge). You must meet all the criteria of the event to qualify for a payout. We have sole discretion in determining whether you have met the criteria and are eligible for a prize. Participants must also be in good standing (no account bans or violations of these Terms) to receive any reward.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>One Prize Per Event:</strong> Many cash prize events will be limited to one prize per user or per household. In other words, you cannot win the same contest multiple times. Prizes are non-transferable; you cannot assign your reward to another person. If an event has a single winner or a limited number of winners, and you are not selected as a winner, you are not entitled to any reward from that event. All company decisions regarding winners are final.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reward Amounts:</strong> The amount of any cash prize will be disclosed in the App as part of the event details. Cash reward amounts can vary. Small prizes might be just a few dollars, whereas special contests might offer larger payouts. There is no regular schedule or guarantee of prize opportunities – they are occasional promotions to reward active and skilled players. We reserve the right to cap the total amount of rewards any single user can earn over a period of time, and to modify or cancel any reward event before it concludes (for example, if we detect fraud or technical issues).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Verification and Documentation:</strong> Before receiving a cash payout, you may be required to verify your identity and eligibility. This includes confirming you are 18 or older (we may ask for a copy of a government ID), and that you were physically present at the required location in the U.S. when participating (we may verify your GPS logs). We may also require you to sign an affidavit of eligibility and release, especially for larger prizes. Failure to provide any requested verification or paperwork within a reasonable time may result in forfeiture of the prize. Tamar reserves the right to disqualify any winner (and refuse to award a prize) if we suspect any cheating, violation of these Terms, or fraudulent behavior in connection with the contest.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Payment Method:</strong> Cash rewards will generally be paid via one-time electronic payment, such as through a digital payment service (for example, PayPal, Venmo, or direct bank ACH transfer). We will contact you via the email associated with your account with instructions on how to claim your reward. You are responsible for providing us with accurate payment details in a timely manner. If a prize is delivered via a third-party payment processor, you must comply with that service’s terms to receive the money (e.g., having a valid account and completing any verification they require). We are not responsible for any delays or issues once the payment is transferred (for instance, if the payment service holds or denies the transfer).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prize Delivery Timing:</strong> We strive to award prizes promptly. However, please allow up to 30 days from the date we announce or confirm you as a winner for delivery of the payout (to account for verification and processing). If you haven’t received an expected prize after 30 days, contact us so we can investigate. Delays might occur due to verification needs or technical constraints, and by accepting these Terms you understand there is no guaranteed timeframe for reward delivery.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Taxes:</strong> Any cash prizes you win are your sole responsibility with regard to taxes. Tamar Innovations LLC is not providing tax advice; however, be aware that prize winnings may be considered taxable income under U.S. law. We may ask you to complete a W-9 form (for U.S. residents) or other tax documentation if required by law (for example, if your total prizes exceed a certain threshold in a year). We may also be required to issue you (and file with the IRS) a Form 1099 or other applicable tax forms reporting the prize amount. By accepting a prize, you acknowledge that you are responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Restrictions and Voidance:</strong> Employees, contractors, or partners of Tamar Innovations LLC, and their immediate family/household members, are not eligible to win cash prizes. We reserve the right to void any prize win or disqualify you if we determine that you violated the rules of the contest or these Terms, or if the contest results were impacted by a bug, exploit, or technical failure. If a prize is mistakenly credited or awarded to you (due to error or fraud), we may revoke it or require you to return or repay the prize. Prizes that are unclaimed after a certain period (e.g., if we cannot reach you for 60 days) may be forfeited. All promotions and contests in the App are void where prohibited by law.
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>
By participating in any in-app challenge or event that offers a reward, you agree to these conditions. No Purchase Necessary: While the App requires a subscription for general use, there is no additional purchase required specifically to enter any contest. If any contest requires a purchase or fee beyond your normal subscription, it will be clearly disclosed (and will be structured as a skill- based competition, not a game of chance). You further acknowledge that winning is not guaranteed, and Tamar has the right to end or cancel any promotional event at any time, especially if integrity or fairness is compromised.</p>


      <h2 id="location-safety" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  6. Acceptable Use and Community Conduct
</h2>
<p>
  We expect all Hunters users to engage in responsible, lawful, and respectful behavior. By using the App, you agree to abide by the following rules and not engage in any prohibited conduct. Violation of these rules may result in suspension or termination of your account without refund, and/or other legal consequences.
</p>

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3 mb-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Violate Laws or Safety:</strong> Use the App in any way that violates any applicable law or regulation, or that encourages any illegal activity. In particular, do not trespass on private property or access any location without proper permission while playing the game. Do not use the App while driving, operating machinery, or in any situation where using a mobile device could put you or others in danger. Always be aware of your surroundings and put safety first. You agree that you will not put yourself or others at risk of injury, death, or property damage in pursuit of in-game objectives.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cheat or Tamper with the Game:</strong> You must not cheat, hack, or otherwise interfere with the intended functioning of the App. This includes (but is not limited to) no modifying the App’s code, no use of bots, scripts, or automated tools to gain an unfair advantage, and no GPS or location spoofing (i.e., you may not use any technique to falsify your device’s geographic location). You also agree not to exploit any bugs or glitches: if you discover a vulnerability or error, you should report it to us, not use it for advantage. Similarly, do not attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise access the App’s source code or proprietary algorithms.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multiple Accounts / Unauthorized Access:</strong> Do not create more than one account for yourself, and do not use anyone else’s account. You may not share your login credentials or let others use your account. Do not attempt to access accounts that aren’t yours or evade account bans. Using unauthorized third-party software or devices to access the App (including modified apps or emulators not approved by us) is prohibited.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Harass or Harm Others:</strong> Maintain a friendly and respectful community. Do not harass, threaten, bully, or stalk other players. This includes any form of abuse, hate speech, or discrimination. You may not use the App to engage in or facilitate any harmful or violent behavior, or to encourage others to do so. Treat all other users with respect, both within any in-app communications and during real-world interactions related to the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Inappropriate Content:</strong> You are responsible for any content you contribute (such as profile information, chat messages, forum posts, etc.). You agree not to post or transmit any content that is illegal, obscene, pornographic, defamatory, libelous, hateful, or that violates any third-party rights. This includes not using usernames or profile images that are offensive, infringing, or impersonate someone else. We have a zero-tolerance policy for content that is sexually explicit, exploits minors, or promotes violence or terrorism.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Commercial or Unauthorized Use:</strong> The App is for personal, non-commercial use only. You may not use the Hunters App to advertise or sell any product or service, to solicit other users for commercial purposes, or to distribute spam or junk messages. You may not resell or commercially exploit any aspect of the App without our prior written consent. Also, do not attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of the game (including user accounts or any potential in-app assets) for real money or value, as such transactions are not authorized.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Interfere with Others’ Enjoyment:</strong> Do not engage in behavior that significantly interferes with the normal gameplay or enjoyment of others. This includes deliberately blocking another player’s progress in the physical world, intentionally triggering false location signals, or sabotaging game events in ways outside the intended rules. Also, do not misuse any in-app communication channels (like chat) to flood, spam, or send malware/phishing links to other users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No Unauthorized Data Collection:</strong> You agree not to data-mine, scrape, or use any automated means to gather information from the App or its users. Collecting other users’ personal information (such as harvesting usernames or emails) without consent is strictly prohibited. You also must not introduce any virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other malicious code into the App’s systems. Attempting to overload or crash the service (e.g., a denial-of-service attack) is illegal and forbidden.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Community Guidelines:</strong> We may publish additional community standards or guidelines (for example, in an FAQ or a “Code of Conduct”). You agree to abide by all such guidelines when using the App. These guidelines are considered part of these Terms. We reserve the right to moderate, monitor, or record interactions in the App (including chat or forums) to enforce these Terms, but we make no guarantee we will do so. Users are encouraged to report any misconduct or violations they observe through the in-app reporting tools or by contacting customer support.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enforcement:</strong> If you violate any of the above rules or any other provision of these Terms, we may issue you a warning, or we may immediately terminate or suspend your access to the App (with no refund of subscription fees) at our discretion. Serious violations (such as illegal acts) may also be reported to law enforcement. You agree that we may take action, up to and including account termination, if we, in our sole judgment, believe you have violated these Terms or the “spirit” of the game.

  7. User-Generated Content and License
</h2>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>User Content:</strong> Hunters may allow users to create, upload, or share content such as profile information, photos, text chat, forum posts, reviews, or other materials (collectively, “User Content”). You retain any intellectual property rights you hold in the content that you create and share on the App. However, by submitting or posting User Content in the App, you grant Tamar Innovations LLC a broad license to use that content for the purposes of operating, improving, and promoting our services. Specifically, you hereby grant us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit your User Content in any media now known or later developed. This license to your content continues even if you stop using the App or your account is terminated (for example, if you posted a gameplay tip in a public forum, we may continue to use that post).
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>Representations:</strong> You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to the User Content you upload (for example, you took the photo or wrote the text yourself, or you have permission from the rights holder). You also promise that your content does not infringe or violate the rights of others, and that it complies with these Terms and all laws. You are solely responsible for your User Content and can be held liable if it’s unlawful or violates someone’s rights.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>No Confidentiality:</strong> Please be aware that any User Content you share in public areas of the App (such as general chat or community forums) is not confidential. Do not share personal or sensitive information that you do not wish to be publicly visible. We are not responsible for the actions of other users who may view and use information you post publicly.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>Monitoring and Moderation:</strong> Tamar has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor, screen, edit or remove any User Content at our discretion. We may remove content that we believe violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable, without notice. However, we do not pre-screen all content, and you understand that by using the App, you may be exposed to content from other users that is offensive or inappropriate. If you see content that violates our rules, please report it. We are not responsible for any failure or delay in removing such content.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>Use of Feedback:</strong> If you submit suggestions, ideas, or feedback to us about the App (“Feedback”), we may use such Feedback for any purpose without obligation to you. Any improvements or modifications to the App based on your Feedback are solely our property.

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>User Interactions:</strong> Please be cautious when interacting with others. You are solely responsible for your interactions (whether online or in person) with other users of the App. We are not responsible for the conduct of any user, and we do not typically screen users’ backgrounds. You agree that we have no liability for any dispute or harm arising from interactions with other users, though we reserve the right to mediate or get involved at our discretion.

  8. Privacy and Data Use
</h2>

<p>
  Your privacy is important to us. Our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of user data are described in our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. By using the Hunters App, you agree to the collection and use of your information as outlined in the Privacy Policy.
</p>

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-2 mt-2">
  <li >
    <strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> Please review our Privacy Policy to understand what information we collect (such as location data, account details, and usage information) and how we use and protect that information. The Privacy Policy also explains the rights and choices you have regarding your personal data. If you do not agree with our data practices, do not use the App.
  </li>
  <li >
    <strong>Location Data:</strong> Because Hunters is location-based, we collect and use your device’s precise geolocation to provide the game’s functionality. For example, the App will use GPS or other location services to place in-game objects relative to your real-world position and to verify you are in allowed areas. We do not use your location for any purposes unrelated to providing or improving the service (such as advertising) without your consent. We do not sell your personal data or location information to third parties. For more details, see the Privacy Policy’s section on location information.
  </li>
  <li >
    <strong>Communication:</strong> By creating an account, you consent to receive transactional communications from us (e.g., account notices, receipts, technical alerts). We may also send you promotional communications (such as newsletters or updates about new features or events), but you will have the opportunity to opt out of marketing emails.
  </li>
  <li >
    <strong>Data Security:</strong> We implement security measures to protect your personal information. However, no system is 100% secure. You acknowledge that there is some risk of data breach or unauthorized access, and you agree that we will not be liable for any such unauthorized access as long as we have taken reasonable precautions. If we become aware of a security incident affecting your data, we will notify you as required by law.
  </li>
  <li >
    <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> The App may integrate third-party services (for example, for payment processing, or social logins). By using those features, you agree that your data may be shared with those third parties as needed to operate that feature. We are not responsible for how third parties handle your information, but we only partner with services that we believe have reasonable data practices. For details, see the Privacy Policy and the third-party service’s own privacy terms.
  </li>
  <li >
    <strong>Children’s Data:</strong> As noted, the App is not intended for anyone under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If we find that we have inadvertently collected personal information from someone under 18, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law. If you are a parent/guardian and believe your minor child has created an account or provided personal data, please contact us to have the data removed.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By using the App, you also agree to the data practices described above and in our Privacy Policy. If you have questions about privacy, you can contact us at the email provided in the Privacy Policy or Section 14 of these Terms.

This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the service as provided by us, in the manner permitted by these Terms.

    <strong>Restrictions:</strong> You agree not to copy, distribute, modify, create derivative works based on, publicly perform, publicly display, rent, lease, sell, or exploit any part of the App or its content (other than your own User Content) without our prior written permission.

To the extent required by the licenses of open-source components, Tamar acknowledges those licenses and will make any required disclosures in the App or documentation.

  10. Disclaimer of Warranties
</h2>

<p>
  Hunters is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. Tamar Innovations LLC makes no warranties or guarantees of any kind about the App. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, regarding the App and your use of it. This includes, but is not limited to:
</p>

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3 mb-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Implied Warranties:</strong> Any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade are expressly disclaimed. We do not warrant that the App will meet your requirements or achieve any intended results.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Service Quality:</strong> We do not guarantee that the App (or any content on it) will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free. Hunters is a complex service that may suffer occasional outages or bugs. There may be times when the game is unavailable for maintenance or due to technical issues. We are not responsible for any delay or failure of the App to perform. You assume the risk of any and all damage or loss from use of, or inability to use, the App.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accuracy of Information:</strong> Any information or advice (e.g., gameplay tips, location information, or prize details) presented within the App or by us is for general informational purposes. While we strive for accuracy, we make no warranty that any such information is accurate, complete, or reliable. Use it at your own risk.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Safety and Your Conduct:</strong> We make no guarantees regarding your personal safety when using the App. You acknowledge that playing location-based games involves inherent risks (such as walking or traveling in public) and that you use the App at your own risk. We are not responsible for any property damage, injuries, or legal consequences (e.g., citations for trespassing or traffic violations) that you may incur while playing Hunters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No Warranty for Content:</strong> We are not responsible for User Content or third-party content on the App. We do not endorse or make any warranty about the accuracy or reliability of any content that users or advertisers contribute. Any opinions or information expressed by third parties belong to those parties, not to us.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> If the App integrates or links to any third-party services (like a payment processor or social media), we make no warranty as to those services. Your dealings with third parties are solely between you and them. We don’t guarantee that any third-party integration will function without interruption or error.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No Continuous Service Obligation:</strong> We do not guarantee that we will continue supporting or offering the App indefinitely. We reserve the right to discontinue or change the App (or any feature of it) at any time, without notice, for any reason. The App could be shut down or retired, and we are not obligated to provide compensation for any inconvenience or loss of data that may result.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Specific Disclaimer for Prizes:</strong> While we intend to honor all legitimate prize awards, we do not warrant that any particular prize will always be available or actually awarded. All prizes are subject to verification. We make no guarantee that participating in the game will result in any earnings or that any user will receive a particular number or frequency of opportunities to win.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You understand that use of the App is at your sole risk. No advice or information (whether oral or written) obtained by you from Tamar or through the App will create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms. If the law of your state does not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, then some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. In that case, any required warranties will be limited in duration to the minimum period allowed by law.
</p>

<h2 id="liability" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  11. Limitation of Liability
</h2>

<p className="mb-2">
  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Tamar Innovations LLC and its affiliates, officers, employees,
  agents, partners, and licensors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or
  exemplary damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, arising out of or in connection with your use of (or inability
  to use) the Hunters App or these Terms. This exclusion of liability applies to, but is not limited to, any damages for
  lost data, lost opportunity, service interruptions, device damage, or failure to receive any benefit or prize from
  using the App.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  In no event will our total cumulative liability to you for all claims relating to the use of the App exceed the
  greater of: (a) the total amount you have paid to us in subscription fees in the 12 months immediately prior to the
  event giving rise to the liability, or (b) US $100. If you have paid nothing (for example, if you were on a free trial
  or promotional access), our total liability shall not exceed US $100. This limitation applies to any and all claims,
  whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, even if we have
  been advised of the possibility of such damages or liability, and even if any limited remedy herein is found to have
  failed of its essential purpose.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
    <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some
    of the above limitations may not apply to you. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent
    permitted by law. We do not seek to exclude liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or any injury caused
    by our fraud or misrepresentation, to the extent that such exclusion is not lawful. Additionally, because you are
    using the App in the U.S., you may have certain statutory rights (for example, under consumer protection laws) that
    cannot be waived, and nothing in these Terms is meant to limit your rights beyond what is permissible.
 </p>

<p className="mb-2">
  You agree that if you are dissatisfied with any aspect of the App, or with these Terms, your sole and exclusive remedy
  is to stop using the App.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  This limitation of liability is part of the basis of the bargain between you and Tamar; the pricing of our service
  (including the decision to offer cash prizes) would be different if we had to assume greater liability.
</p>

<h2 id="indemnification" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  12. Indemnification
</h2>

<p className="mb-2">
  You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Tamar Innovations LLC, its parent and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arise out of or relate to (a) your use or misuse of the Hunters App, (b) your violation of any term of these Terms, or (c) your violation of any rights of a third party (for example, if you post content that infringes someone’s copyright or you physically harm someone in connection with the game). This obligation will survive any termination of your account or these Terms.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim and not to settle any such matter without our prior written consent.
</p>

<h2 id="termination" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  13. Termination and Suspension
</h2>

<p className="mb-2">
  Term: These Terms apply to you as soon as you first access the App and will remain in effect until
  terminated by either you or us.
</p>

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3 mb-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Your Right to Terminate:</strong> You may cease using the App at any time. You may also delete your account (if a deletion feature is available in-app or by contacting support). Termination of your account does not entitle you to any refund of subscription fees already paid, except as explicitly provided in Section 3 or required by law. Even after you stop using your account, certain sections of these Terms will survive (such as our rights regarding content you’ve already provided, indemnification obligations, disclaimers, and limitations of liability).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Our Right to Suspend/Terminate:</strong> We may suspend or terminate your access to the App (or terminate these Terms as they apply to you) at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. For example, we may suspend/terminate for prolonged inactivity, failure to pay subscription fees, violation of these Terms, or if we discontinue the App. In most cases of minor violations, we will try to give a warning or notice before terminating, but we are not obligated to do so. If your account is terminated due to a breach of these Terms or misconduct, you will not be entitled to any refunds and you may lose access to any benefits, achievements, or content associated with your account. Additionally, you may be prohibited from re-registering or using the App in the future.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon any termination of your account, whether initiated by you or us, your right to use the App will immediately cease. You should understand that we may delete or anonymize your account data and User Content after termination, and you will no longer be able to retrieve that information (except as otherwise noted in our Privacy Policy or required by law). Any provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (such as disclaimers, limitations of liability, waivers, indemnifications, governing law, etc.) shall continue to be in effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Discontinuation of Service:</strong> If Tamar, in its sole discretion, discontinues the Hunters App entirely (for example, shutting down the game and not offering it anymore), we will endeavor to notify you in advance. In such event, all user accounts may be terminated, and any subscription that has been paid for but not fully used will be handled according to our refund policy or applicable law. We will have no further liability to you in connection with such general discontinuation beyond refunding any unused portion of your subscription, if required.
  </li>
</ul>

     <h2 id="governing-law" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
</h2>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>Governing Law:</strong> These Terms and any dispute arising out of or related to them or the Hunters App will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. This means that Delaware state law (and U.S. federal law, as applicable) will govern any issues or claims about these Terms or the App, even if you reside or use the App elsewhere. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>Jurisdiction and Venue:</strong> You agree that any dispute or claim you may have against Tamar arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Hunters App will be exclusively adjudicated in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. You consent to personal jurisdiction in Delaware, and you waive any objections based on inconvenient forum or jurisdiction. (If you and we both agree, we can choose an alternative dispute resolution method such as arbitration or small claims court for a particular dispute, but absent mutual agreement otherwise, disputes shall be resolved in Delaware courts.)
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> To the extent permitted by law, you agree that any claims against us must be brought solely in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. This means you are waiving any right to litigate disputes as a class action or collective action against Tamar.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>Injunctive Relief:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, you acknowledge that unauthorized use of our App or breach of our intellectual property rights may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be inadequate. We reserve the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction (and you agree that we won’t have to post a bond or meet any other conditions precedent to seek such relief) in the event of such a breach.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>Localized Provisions:</strong> If you reside in a jurisdiction that prohibits the enforcement of any part of this Section 14, such as a requirement that local law apply or that disputes be resolved in local courts, then that local law may override the above to the minimum extent necessary. In such cases, this Section 14 shall be deemed modified to reflect the minimum mandates of your jurisdiction. However, the rest of these Terms will remain in full effect.
</p>

<h2 id="changes" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  15. Changes to These Terms
</h2>

<p className="mb-2">
  Tamar Innovations LLC may update or revise these Terms from time to time. We might do this to reflect changes in the law, new features, or changes in business practices. When we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms in the App and adjusting the “Effective Date” at the top, and/or by sending you a notification (e.g., via email or an in-app alert). It is your responsibility to review any revised Terms.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  <strong>Continued Use Deemed Acceptance:</strong> If you continue to use the Hunters App after the Terms have been updated, that will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to any update, you must stop using the App and, if applicable, cancel your subscription. We encourage you to check back periodically to review the latest version of these Terms.
</p>

<p className="mb-2">
  No amendment or modification of these Terms will be binding unless in writing and posted by us as described above. For clarity, certain features or promotions in the App may come with their own supplemental terms; in the event of a conflict between those specific terms and these general Terms, the specific terms for that feature or event will govern to the extent of the conflict.
</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  16. Miscellaneous
</h2>

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3 mb-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms (along with any additional rules, guidelines, or policies incorporated by reference, including the Privacy Policy and any game-specific rules) constitute the entire agreement between you and Tamar Innovations LLC regarding the Hunters App. They supersede all prior understandings or agreements (whether oral or written) regarding the same subject matter.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of that right or provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by us to be effective.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. These Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> These Terms are between you and Tamar. Except as expressly provided, no other person or entity shall have any rights under these Terms as a third-party beneficiary. (For example, even though app store providers are not parties to these Terms, certain provisions may explicitly benefit them and thus be enforceable by them as third-party beneficiaries under applicable law.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Relationship of Parties:</strong> You and we are independent contracting parties. These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship, and neither party has authority to bind the other in any way.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Headings:</strong> Section titles or headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Translations:</strong> These Terms are written in English. If we provide a translation, it is for your convenience only. In the event of any discrepancy between the English version and a translated version, the English version will govern.
  </li>
